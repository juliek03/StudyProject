Project 3 / Create a video game

This is a study project which aims to acquire and master the basics of object-oriented programming.

This third study project, is based on the creation of a video game without a user interface and without visuals but which can be used.

It consists in creating only a game prototype, a simple application that implements the logic of the game and that only allows fighting between characters.

It is an RPG type game, there is a selection of characters, at a rate of 3 per player. The fighting characters are all equipped with a weapon that causes damage. In addition to these features: a chest can appear during the game, and contain a weapon. At the end of the game, each character's stats must be displayed.
